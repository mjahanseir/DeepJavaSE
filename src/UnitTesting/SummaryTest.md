- Unit Testing (UT)
    steps:
        1.create test class
        2.import Junit  ...... add an import line and auto include
        3.create test methods
           -must use @Test
        4.add assertions


- Test Driven Development (TDD)
    - not unit testing ..... but UT is a needed tool
    - TDD is based on the idea of starting with the test,
      then writing the code after
    - This helps keep our development tied to requirements
        b/c the test is written for that , not the code.


- TDD workflow:
    -Red,Green,Refactor
           - Red:      write a test that will fail
           - Green:    write the minimal code to pass
           - Refactor: any cleanup if necessary

This was a simple method but many have seemed like a lot of work.
       -Whatâ€™s the benefit then?
Focus on writing test first thinking about the requirements first.
